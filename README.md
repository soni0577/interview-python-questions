in this repo i am going to upload my all programs, notes, articles which i've gone through. Its free, go ahead and find the code you want, HAPPY TO HELP :-)


-> this file coontains a code which works to match outstated list of ascii values from list of charecters after finding the difference, i am stating some
steps below to understand that how this program works.
steps are:
  1- first of all get the input of charecter list
  2- now find out the ASCII value of each charecter
  3- store those values in another list
  4- reverse that list elements and store it to another one named(first_rev)
  5- subtract 1st number from second and store that in list named (f_sub_list) and do same with other elements by iterating over the current ASCII list
  6- now take the original ASCII list (not reversed) and apply step 5 which i stated just above, on original ASCII numbers list
  7- now you have two lists of differenced values, you need to sort both of them
  8- now compare both and make a plag that if those are same say "funny" and if not, say "not funny"

That's it guys, will be there to help you more :-)
